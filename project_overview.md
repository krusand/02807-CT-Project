# Project Overview




# Market Basket Analysis
Orders (Basket) - Products (Items)
- Make Rules

# Clustering
- Cluster on User ID using different orders
- Cluster orders using embeddings of products using BERT or Word2Vec

# RecSys
- Make collaborative filtering




# Possible projects
- Graph cluster of warehouse aisle (optimization problem)
- Recommendation system for discounts
- Recommendation system using word2vec for recommending multiple similar items
- Clustering users for (personal) ads, used by Instacart for bulk buying products. Looking up prices.
- Clustering orders for recsys
- Clustering using prices
- RQ: What product should we put on discount for the highest probability for a user to buy, depending on week
- Recommendation system comparison using aisle id compared with using word2vec/BERT and cosine similarity with threshold to categorize products. (Baseline for both: Recommend the most popular item in aisle/embedding group)
- 

# Chosen project
- Recommend product using one of the following methods:
    - Market Basket Analysis using Association rules. Choose the products with high lift
    - Recommendation system using CF with item's aisle id's instead of item id
    - Recommendation system using CF with item's cluster id (based on our clusters)
    - Get ratio of rec/rand using either:
        - Bought before ratio of new vs already bought
        - Clustering users based on frequency, baskets, other features, and use the ratio of bought before


    - Recommendation system using CF
    
    - Recommendation system using CF with item text embedding
